-kmap_atomic_pfn isn't really supposed to be used with device pages, but it
-provides an efficient mapping for this usage.
-
-On 32-bit processors without HIGHMEM defined, io_mapping_map_atomic_wc and
-io_mapping_map_wc both use ioremap_wc, a terribly inefficient function which
-performs an IPI to inform all processors about the new mapping. This results
-in a significant performance penalty.

-/**
- * migrate_enable - Allow migration of the current task
+ * Per this argument, the change from preempt_disable() to migrate_disable()
+ * gets us:
+ *
+ * - a higher priority tasks gains reduced wake-up latency; with preempt_disable()
+ *   it would have had to wait for the lower priority task.
+ *
+ * - a lower priority tasks; which under preempt_disable() could've instantly
+ *   migrated away when another CPU becomes available, is now constrained
+ *   by the ability to push the higher priority task away, which might itself be
+ *   in a migrate_disable() section, reducing it's available bandwidth.
+ *
+ * IOW it trades latency / moves the interference term, but it stays in the
+ * system, and as long as it remains unbounded, the system is not fully
+ * deterministic.
  *
- * Counterpart to migrate_disable().
  *
- * As migrate_disable() can be invoked nested, only the outermost invocation
- * reenables migration.
+ * The reason we have it anyway.
+ *
+ * PREEMPT_RT breaks a number of assumptions traditionally held. By forcing a
+ * number of primitives into becoming preemptible, they would also allow
+ * migration. This turns out to break a bunch of per-cpu usage. To this end,
+ * all these primitives employ migirate_disable() to restore this implicit
+ * assumption.
+ *
+ * This is a 'temporary' work-around at best. The correct solution is getting
+ * rid of the above assumptions and reworking the code to employ explicit
+ * per-cpu locking or short preempt-disable regions.
+ *
+ * The end goal must be to get rid of migrate_disable(), alternatively we need
+ * a schedulability theory that does not depend on abritrary migration.
+ *
+ *
+ * Notes on the implementation.
+ *
+ * The implementation is particularly tricky since existing code patterns
+ * dictate neither migrate_disable() nor migrate_enable() is allowed to block.
+ * This means that it cannot use cpus_read_lock() to serialize against hotplug,
+ * nor can it easily migrate itself into a pending affinity mask change on
+ * migrate_enable().
+ *
+ *
+ * Note: even non-work-conserving schedulers like semi-partitioned depends on
+ *       migration, so migrate_disable() is not only a problem for
+ *       work-conserving schedulers.
  *

+ * running, we have to kick it out using the CPU stopper.
+ *
+ * Migrate-Disable comes along and tramples all over our nice sandcastle.
+ * Consider:
+ *
+ *     Initial conditions: P0->cpus_mask = [0, 1]
+ *
+ *     P0@CPU0                  P1

+ *     <preempted>
+ *                              set_cpus_allowed_ptr(P0, [1]);
+ *
+ * P1 *cannot* return from this set_cpus_allowed_ptr() call until P0 executes
+ * its outermost migrate_enable() (i.e. it exits its Migrate-Disable region).
+ * This means we need the following scheme:
+ *
+ *     P0@CPU0                  P1
+ *
+ *     migrate_disable();
+ *     <preempted>
+ *                              set_cpus_allowed_ptr(P0, [1]);
+ *                                <blocks>
+ *     <resumes>
+ *     migrate_enable();
+ *       __set_cpus_allowed_ptr();
+ *       <wakes local stopper>
+ *                         `--> <woken on migration completion>
+ *
+ * Now the fun stuff: there may be several P1-like tasks, i.e. multiple
+ * concurrent set_cpus_allowed_ptr(P0, [*]) calls. CPU affinity changes of any
+ * task p are serialized by p->pi_lock, which we can leverage: the one that
+ * should come into effect at the end of the Migrate-Disable region is the last
+ * one. This means we only need to track a single cpumask (i.e. p->cpus_mask),
+ * but we still need to properly signal those waiting tasks at the appropriate
+ * moment.
+ *
+ * This is implemented using struct set_affinity_pending. The first
+ * __set_cpus_allowed_ptr() caller within a given Migrate-Disable region will
+ * setup an instance of that struct and install it on the targeted task_struct.
+ * Any and all further callers will reuse that instance. Those then wait for
+ * a completion signaled at the tail of the CPU stopper callback (1), triggered
+ * on the end of the Migrate-Disable region (i.e. outermost migrate_enable()).
+ *
+ *
+ * (1) In the cases covered above. There is one more where the completion is
+ * signaled within affine_move_task() itself: when a subsequent affinity request
+ * cancels the need for an active migration. Consider:
+ *
+ *     Initial conditions: P0->cpus_mask = [0, 1]
+ *
+ *     P0@CPU0            P1                             P2
+ *
+ *     migrate_disable();
