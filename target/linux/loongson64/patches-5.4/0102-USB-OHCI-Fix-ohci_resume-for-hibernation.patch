Subject: [PATCH 102/131] USB: OHCI: Fix ohci_resume() for hibernation

During hibernation restore, some OHCI controllers (such as in AMD RS780
and Loongson LS7A) may generate RHSC interrupt. Once RHSC interrupt
occurs, it will be NOT really handled (just return IRQ_NOTMINE) by
ohci_irq() because of OHCI_RH_HALTED at that time, until HCR command
done.

So we turn off MIE before OHCI reset to prevent from possible interrupt
so that to reset safely. MIE will be enabled later in ohci_rh_resume(),
and as a result this patch is also suitable for controllers without
this trouble.
